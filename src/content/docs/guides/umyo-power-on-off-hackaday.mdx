1. Before turning on, you need to attach the battery to the uMyo:

You can use a battery with a JST connector cable (links to suitable ones can be found above);
You can also solder any lipo battery directly to BAT+ and BAT- pads on uMyo;
Always use only one battery for all connected uMyo devices;
After plugging the battery, it's ready for use;
Charging the battery: you can plug a USB-C cable into any uMyo connected to the battery to charge it, even if it's one of several uMyos connected together.
2. Press button to turn uMyo on;

3. You should see several LED blinks: - red-red-green, blue, then it will blink 3 times indicating current radio mode:

pink - nRF24 mode
blue - BLE mode
green - PC station mode
4. Turning off: hold button for more than 2 seconds. LED will switch from blue to red, release the button -> uMyo stays off.
