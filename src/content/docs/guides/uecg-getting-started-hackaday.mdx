title: Getting Started with uECG
description: old guide to using uECG from Hackaday, now partially outdated
---

Welcome, everyone!

This is an instruction on how to use uECG kits that we sell, but it’s also useful if you want to make your own uECG. Or maybe you were just browsing Hackaday and accidentally found our projects. In any case, thank you for being interested in uECG! 

We have created a Discord Chat for additional support or feedback, join us!

For clarity, we also made this video to show everything described in the instruction:

We tried to make the package as simple and environmentally friendly as possible! It doesn’t contain plastic packaging, but is still antistatic and protects well. 

The devices (uECG, base and programmer) are stored in separate cardboard cutouts; the electrodes, wires and pins are in the smaller box.

The most popular (Developer’s) uECG kit includes the following:

- uECG device;
- 3D-printed case;
- 10 single-use electrodes;
- base station for connecting to laptop/PC (a simple nRF52832 USB board designed by us);
- USB programmer for firmware upload (ST-Link v2, we use a tested Chinese clone);
- pogo pin adapter (4 pogo pins/2.54 spacing).
