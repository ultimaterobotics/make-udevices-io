Using with Arduino:

uMyo is a muscle activity sensor that transmits data wirelessly to Arduino. Two standard options are supported: nRF24 module with any Arduino model, or transfer via BLE directly to ESP32 boards.

For using with nRF24 module, use uMyo_RF24 library from Arduino library manager (or download it here: https://github.com/ultimaterobotics/uMyo_RF24 ). Library contains basic examples allowing to get data from uMyo devices

See video instruction for more details:

Using with ESP32:

For ESP32, use uMyo_BLE library from Arduino library manager (or download it here: https://github.com/ultimaterobotics/uMyo_BLE ). Library contains the same examples as RF24 version with similar usage.
