title: uMyo - wearable EMG sensor
description: Collected information about uMyo, the wearable EMG sensor
---

uMyo is a single channel wearable EMG sensor with wireless data transmission. Multiple sensors can be connected to one receiver.
uMyo is a flexible EMG system allowing to pick up signals from different muscles - and not only from arms, but also legs, torso or even face.
It is certified open source hardware (https://certification.oshwa.org/ua000003.html)

## Main features of uMyo are:
- It's wireless! No more mess of wires when working with EMG
- Works with any Arduino via nRF24 radio module (you can use our Arduino library)
- Works with ESP32 with no extra hardware (we also wrote an Arduino library)
- Multiple units (up to 12 in current version) can send data to the same Arduino/ESP32
- Sends out detected muscle activity level, 4-bins spectrum; and raw EMG data (in nRF24 mode)
- Can be used with a bracelet and dry electrodes, or with gel electrodes via soldered connector
