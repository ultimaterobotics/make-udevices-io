## Power on/off
Turn on the the slider on the side of the device - slider switch is used for shipping and long storage modes, not required for standard use
Press a button - the device will turn on immediately. You should see a series of blinks on the left side - first red, green, blue; then three green flashes; then pink. The pink LED means the device is on and ready to use;
The pink LED should periodically flash when device sees R peaks in ECG - i.e. in contact with the skin.
To power off, press and hold the button for 3 seconds. LED should switch from green to red, then you can release the button

## Usage
Attach round gel electrodes to the snap connectors on the bottom of uECG;
Peel off the protective layer from them and stick them to the chest as shown in picture below;
Gently press the device onto the skin once to ensure it sticks;
After use, peel off the device and detach the electrodes (they are single-use);
It’s good to minimize the amount of hair and wipe the skin with alcohol for better signal. It will also be easier to remove, too :)

Please turn off uECG after use! Current version doesn't automatically turn off when no skin contact is present.

## Charge (optional)
uECG uses a micro USB port for charging. You can charge it from a usual phone 5V USB adapter (or laptop/PC USB port). Insert the micro USB cable into the port and the device will begin charging;
Remove the cable to stop charging;
The device does not have to be turned on to charge.
We hope you will enjoy using uECG! Please write us if something doesn’t work - if everything works, write too :)
