title: Using uMyo with bracelet and dry connectors

1. First you need to attach dry connectors to uMyo. The board has two holes for attaching connectors (see the figure above) - a cross-shaped screw is inserted on the side of the components, and a bolt with a flat head is screwed into it on the back side, flat surface contacts the skin.

2. Pass through the "ear" (see picture above) one end of the bracelet and fix it with Velcro. Pass the second edge of the bracelet through the second "ear".

3. Put the bracelet in this form on your hand and find the necessary muscle position by alternately squeezing your fingers or fist.

4. After determining the required active muscle, place the uMyo connectors on it and tighten the bracelet so that it sits tightly, fix the selected position with Velcro (which is located on the second end of the bracelet).

5. After placing it is necessary to check whether the position is optimal by repeated contraction of the selected muscle. The Muscle Activity LED (see picture above) should glow brighter with each contraction. This way you will know that the device captures your movements.
