title: Using uMyo with disposable gel electrodes and wet connectors

1. First you need to attach the wet connectors (see the picture above) to the uMyo using soldering. The board has two holes for attaching connectors (see the figure above). We made a video of this process in links from the QR code.

2. Snap two gel electrodes to the soldered connectors.

3. Find the required muscle by alternately squeezing your fingers or fist.

4. After determining the desired active muscle, fix the gel electrodes on it.

5. After placing it is necessary to check whether the position is optimal by repeated contraction of the selected muscle. The Muscle Activity LED (see picture above) should glow brighter with each contraction. This way you will know that the device captures your movements.
