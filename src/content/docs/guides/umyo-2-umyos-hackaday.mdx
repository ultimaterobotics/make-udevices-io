uMyo library allows using multiple uMyo devices simultaneously without additional efforts - it reports amount of devices available, and all parameters can be obtained for any of them at any moment. 

Although the more devices are present, the higher is chance of radio data overlapping, so if many uMyo are active, data rate would become lower.
