uMyo is a fairly versatile device, so we designed it so that some users do not spend money on additional components or can purchase them in any online store (or local) if necessary.

We have created a Discord Chat for additional support or feedback, join us!

What components are we talking about?

1. Battery. You can solder any lipo battery to uMyo, but you can also plug in any battery with a 2-pin 2mm JST-PH connector. Links to some suitable batteries are below:

https://www.adafruit.com/product/1570 - this one is from Adafruit and can be ordered quickly if you're in the US.

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32617056181.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.4fc075e1xbrbGy&algo_pvid=9b750b75-f41e-4ea3-80dd-f674e1b0e7e6&algo_exp_id=9b750b75-f41e-4ea3-80dd-f674e1b0e7e6-25&pdp_ext_f=%7B - this one is from AliExpress and will take more time to arrive if you order. There are several options: you need the '2 line 2mm' option. If you order, make sure the red and black wires match the + and - of the JST connector on uMyo.

2. Arduino: uMyo can be used with any Arduino via nRF24 radio module.

3. ESP32: uMyo can be used directly with ESP32 BLE radio, with no additional hardware required
